To answer this, I need to identify logos associated with sea creatures and determine which ones are commonly seen on racecars.

However, a prominent example is the 'Sea Horse' or 'Dolphin' motifs, but none are as iconic as the 'Octopus'. Another possibility is the 'Squid' or 'Kraken' imagery. A more plausible candidate is the 'Sea Lion' or 'Dolphin', but these are less common. Alternatively, the 'Turtle' or 'Whale' might be considered, but again, not typically associated with racing. The most famous example is the 'Octopus' logo of the brand 'Octane', but it's not widely recognized. Another possibility is the 'Shark' from the 'Shark Racing' team or the 'Shark' emblem used by some manufacturers.

Shark is a SQL query engine for Hadoop that was developed by Apache and is known to run on top of Hadoop's HDFS and MapReduce. Next, I need to determine what system has a slower response time than Impala and Shark. Impala and Shark are both SQL engines for Hadoop, but Impala is generally faster than Shark due to its in-memory processing capabilities. A system with slower response time than both might be Hive, which is known to be slower due to its reliance on MapReduce for execution. Hive also runs on top of Hadoop. Therefore, both Shark and Hive run on top of Hadoop.

To answer this, I need to first understand the context in which C is proportional to another term. This likely involves a mathematical or physical relationship where C ∝ (some expression), and I need to identify the numerator of that expression. Since the question is vague without context, I will search for common scenarios where C is proportional to a term with a numerator, such as in physics equations or mathematical formulas.<\/think>\n<search>symbol for numerator in proportionality term where C is proportional to<\/search>"
